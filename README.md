### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am just a tech nerd who loves learning and making things better(that includes myself).
A bit of a perfectionist, but who isn't in some form?

Looking to help the tech community and help others along the way. There is no "i" in team, especially one as large as we have as software devs, engineers, 
DevOps, IT, Sec anaylsts... the list goes on. 

I do codewars and HTB sometimes. Mostly been really busy with my current job being head dev.(Which I didn't plan on getting it -- guess that is how things go sometimes)
