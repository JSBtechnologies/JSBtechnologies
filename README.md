I've spent most of my days on here building random things and trying out new ideas. As a self-taught Software Engineer, I've worn many hats—building MVPs for internal products, contributing to startups, and always being a solver of problems.

Once I understand a system or codebase, I see its weaknesses and strengths. From there, I want to build solutions or champion improvements to the processes already in place. I run on the fuel of the doubters and the pure will that comes from my need to outwork others.

I am both a teacher and a student of engineering because there is always more to learn. I write in code and know how transistors function, but I don't limit myself to that domain. Ask me about cars, planes, military technology, or technology in general—I guarantee I've been down a 2AM weekend rabbit hole learning about it!
